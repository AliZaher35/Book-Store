I used two methods to connect to the database, and on the Create Tables page, I displayed the tables and relationships.
In this application, I wanted to implant data from a JSON file based on relationships between tables to prevent data from being duplicated during the implantation process.
As for the filter, it can be developed according to the clientâ€™s requirements. I have included a button to attach the data to the database,
which is an initial idea for a project that can be built on.
